# monolish: MONOlithic LInear equation Solvers for Highly-parallel architecture
monolish is a linear equation solver library that monolithically fuses variable data type, matrix structures, matrix data format, vendor specific data transfer APIs, and vendor specific numerical algebra libraries.

monolish let developer forget about:
- Performance tuning
- Processor differences which execute library (Intel CPU, NVIDIA GPU, AMD CPU, ARM CPU, NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA, etc.)
- Vendor specific data transfer APIs (host RAM to Device RAM)
- Finding bottlenecks and performance benchmarks
- The argument data type of matrix/vector operations
- Matrix structures and storage formats
- Cumbersome package dependency

Quick start guide
---
The GPU implementation requires OpenMP Offloading in clang. Enabling OpenMP Offloading requires an option to be specified when building clang. This is not practical.

To use pre-built monolish, use apt or Docker Container with monolish installed.
- [Installation using apt (for ubuntu 20.04 and 20.10)](https://ricosjp.github.io/monolish/master/d5/d38/install_guide.html)
- [Docker container with monolish installed](https://ricosjp.github.io/monolish/master/d6/d6f/monolish_docker.html) ([container registory](https://github.com/orgs/ricosjp/packages?repo_name=monolish))

To share the development environment, the monolish development environment is provided in an [allgebra Docker container](https://github.com/ricosjp/allgebra).

See below for how to build on allgebra.
