If you want to contribute to monolish, create an [Issue](https://github.com/ricosjp/monolish/issues) and create a pull request for the Issue.
Before resolving the WIP of the pull request, you need to do the following two things

- Apply clang-format with `make format` command.
- Record the major fixes and the URL of the pull request in `CHANGELOG.md`.

The `make format` command will automatically apply clang-format to all git added files.
