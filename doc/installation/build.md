# Build monolish from source code {#build_guide}

# Introduction

The GPU implementation requires OpenMP Offloading in clang.
Enabling OpenMP Offloading requires an option to be specified when building clang. This is not practical.

To share the development environment, the monolish development environment is provided in an [allgebra Docker container](https://github.com/ricosjp/allgebra).

If you want to add a feature that depends on a new library, please make a pull request to allgebra.

## Enter to allgebra docker container and Building monolish

- CPU, MKL
```
git clone git@github.com:ricosjp/monolish.git
make in_mkl_cpu
make install_cpu
```

- CPU, OSS (for AMD, ARM, Power)
```
git clone git@github.com:ricosjp/monolish.git
make in_oss_cpu
make install_cpu
```

- GPU, MKL
```
git clone git@github.com:ricosjp/monolish.git
make in_mkl_gpu
make install_gpu
```

- GPU, OSS (for NVIDIA GPU on AMD)
```
git clone git@github.com:ricosjp/monolish.git
make in_oss_gpu
make install_gpu
```

monolish will be installed in `MONOLISH_DIR`.
By default, monolish is installed in `/opt/monolish/lib/` and `/opt/monolish/include/`.

In the current version, it is necessary to specify the path to MONOLISH_DIR in order to compile the sample code. For example:

```
g++ -L/opt/monolish/lib/ -I /opt/monolish/include/ sample.cpp -lmonolish_cpu
```

## Build monolish on the local for CPU (Ubuntu)
If Docker is not used, users need to install MKL, OpenBLAS, etc. which they depend on.


monolish requires:

- git
- make
- cmake 3.17 or higher
- g++ or clang++ with C++14 support
- MKL or OpenBLAS


### Install make, cmake, and compilers
Install cmake 3.18:
```
curl -LO https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.18.4/cmake-3.18.4-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz \ && tar xf cmake-3.18.4-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz \ && mv cmake-3.18.4-Linux-x86_64/bin/* /usr/bin/ \ && mv cmake-3.18.4-Linux-x86_64/share/cmake-3.18 /usr/share/ \ && rm -rf cmake-3.18.4-Linux-x86_64*

```

Install gcc, g++, make:
```
apt install -y make gcc g++
```

### Install BLAS Library

Install MKL
```
apt install -y libmkl-dev
```

or install OpenBLAS
```
apt install -y libopenblas-dev
```

### Install monolish

```
git clone git@github.com:ricosjp/monolish.git
cd monolish/
make install_cpu
```

Install directory is `MONOLIDH_DIR`.

## Build monolish on the local for GPU

Installation on the local environment is not supported. This is because monolish requires a clang with OpenMP Offloading enabled.

OpenMP Offloading enabled clang is provided by the following allgebra container.

[allgebra Docker container](https://github.com/ricosjp/allgebra).


## Build monolish for special hardware
- NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA
```
git clone git@github.com:ricosjp/monolish.git
make -f Makefile.sxat
```

- Fujitsu A64fx
```
git clone git@github.com:ricosjp/monolish.git
make -f Makefile.a64fx
```
SXAT and A64fx do not require Docker.


## AMD Radeon GPU and Intel Xe GPU
Currently, it does not work because the code depends on NVIDIA CUDA libraries.

OpenMP Offloading should work on these architecture, so it should be possible to make it work based on the design concept of monolish.

These architectures will be supported in the future.
