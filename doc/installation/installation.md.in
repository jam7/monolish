# Installation using apt {#install_guide}

This page describes how to install pre-build monolish onto Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Following commands assumes `wget` command exists. It can be installed by

\code{shell}
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y wget
\endcode

## For CPU

monolish deb file can be downloaded from [GitHub Release page][release]:

\code{shell}
$ wget ${monolish_release_download_base}/${monolish_deb_oss}
$ sudo apt install -y ./${monolish_deb_oss}
\endcode

There are two variants according to backend BLAS and LAPACK implementation:

- [+oss][deb_oss] means it uses OpenBLAS
- [+mkl][deb_mkl] means it uses Intel MKL

## For NVIDIA GPU

In the current version, monolish for GPU cannot be installed with apt.

Please use the container with [docker container with monolish installed](@ref monolish_docker).

# monolish for NVIDIA GPU depends on CUDA, but monolish deb package does not contains CUDA libraries.
# This deb assumes CUDA apt repository is enabled, and tries to get CUDA libraries from there.
# You can enable the CUDA apt repository as following:
# 
# \code{shell}
# $ wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu2004.pin
# $ sudo mv cuda-ubuntu2004.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
# $ sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub
# $ sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/ /"
# $ sudo apt-get update
# \endcode
# 
# See https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads for more detail.

# monolish deb file can be downloaded from [GitHub Release page][release]:
# 
# \code{shell}
# $ wget ${monolish_release_download_base}/${monolish_deb_oss_nvidia}
# $ sudo apt install -y ./${monolish_deb_oss_nvidia}
# \endcode
# 
# There are two variants according to backend BLAS and LAPACK implementation for CPU:
# 
# - [+oss-nvidia][deb_oss_nvidia] means it uses OpenBLAS and CUDA
# - [+mkl-nvidia][deb_mkl_nvidia] means it uses Intel MKL and CUDA
# 
# CUDA libraries will be installed as its dependencies.
