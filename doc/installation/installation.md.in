# Installation using apt {#install_guide}

This page describes how to install pre-build monolish onto Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Following commands assumes `wget` command exists. It can be installed by

\code{shell}
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y wget
\endcode

## For CPU

monolish deb file can be downloaded from [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/ricosjp/monolish/releases/tag/${PROJECT_VERSION}):

\code{shell}
$ wget https://github.com/ricosjp/monolish/releases/download/${PROJECT_VERSION}/monolish_${PROJECT_VERSION}-1+oss_amd64.deb
$ sudo apt install -y ./monolish_${PROJECT_VERSION}-1+oss_amd64.deb
\endcode

There are two variants according to backend BLAS and LAPACK implementation:

- [+oss](https://github.com/ricosjp/monolish/releases/download/${PROJECT_VERSION}/monolish_${PROJECT_VERSION}-1+oss_amd64.deb) means it uses OpenBLAS
- [+mkl](https://github.com/ricosjp/monolish/releases/download/${PROJECT_VERSION}/monolish_${PROJECT_VERSION}-1+mkl_amd64.deb) means it uses Intel MKL

## For NVIDIA GPU

monolish for NVIDIA GPU depends on CUDA, but monolish deb package does not contains CUDA libraries.
This deb assumes CUDA apt repository is enabled, and tries to get CUDA libraries from there.
You can enable the CUDA apt repository as following:

\code{shell}
$ wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu2004.pin
$ sudo mv cuda-ubuntu2004.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
$ sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub
$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/ /"
$ sudo apt-get update
\endcode

See https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads for more detail.

monolish deb file can be downloaded from [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/ricosjp/monolish/releases/tag/${PROJECT_VERSION}):

\code{shell}
$ wget https://github.com/ricosjp/monolish/releases/download/${PROJECT_VERSION}/monolish_${PROJECT_VERSION}-1+oss+nvidia_amd64.deb
$ sudo apt install -y ./monolish_${PROJECT_VERSION}-1+oss+nvidia_amd64.deb
\endcode

There are two variants according to backend BLAS and LAPACK implementation for CPU:

- [+oss+nvidia](https://github.com/ricosjp/monolish/releases/download/${PROJECT_VERSION}/monolish_${PROJECT_VERSION}-1+oss+nvidia_amd64.deb) means it uses OpenBLAS and CUDA
- [+mkl+nvidia](https://github.com/ricosjp/monolish/releases/download/${PROJECT_VERSION}/monolish_${PROJECT_VERSION}-1+mkl+nvidia_amd64.deb) means it uses Intel MKL and CUDA

CUDA libraries will be installed as its dependencies.
